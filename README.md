# Real-Time Data Visualization with Unity

## Project Description
Develop a real-time data visualization tool using Unity.

## Tools and Skills Utilized
- **Unity**: For designing the visualization interface.
- **C#**: For scripting within Unity.
- **Python**: For data processing.
- **Git**: For version control.
- **VS Code**: For coding.

## Setup and Execution Steps

1. **Design the Visualization Interface Using Unity**
   - Open Unity and create a new project.
   - Design the interface for data visualization using Unity's tools and assets.

2. **Scripting with C# in Unity**
   - Open Unity and create new C# scripts.
   - Implement the necessary logic for data visualization within Unity using C#.

3. **Implement Data Processing in Python**
   - Create Python scripts for data processing.
   - Ensure the data is formatted correctly for visualization in Unity.

4. **Version Control with Git**
   - Initialize a Git repository for the project.
   - Commit changes regularly to keep track of the project's progress.

5. **Coding with VS Code**
   - Use VS Code for writing and editing C# and Python scripts.
   - Ensure proper integration with Unity and Git.
