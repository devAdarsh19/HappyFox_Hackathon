      "instruction set space.\n",
      "• Thumb has higher code density—the space taken up in memory by an \n",
      "executable program—than ARM.\n",
      "• For memory-constrained embedded systems, for example, mobile\n",
      "   phones and PDAs, code density is very important.\n",
      "• On average, a Thumb implementation of the same code takes up \n",
      "around 30% less memory than the equivalent ARM implementation.\n",

      "• ATPCS defines the ARM and Thumb procedure call standards.\n",
      "• To call a Thumb routine from an ARM routine, the core has to change \n",
      "state.\n",
      "• This state change is shown in the T bit of the cpsr.\n",
      "• The BX and BLX branch instructions cause a switch between ARM and \n",

      "\fOther Branch Instructions\n",

      "• The data processing instructions manipulate data within registers.\n",

      "\n",
      "\fStack Instructions\n",
      "\n",
      "• The Thumb stack operations are different from the equivalent ARM \n",
      "instructions because they use the more traditional POP and PUSH \n",
      "concept.\n",
      "\n",
      "• The interesting point to note is that there is no stack pointer in the \n",

      "\n",
      "• Similar to the ARM equivalent, the Thumb software interrupt (SWI) \n",

      "• If any interrupt or exception flag is raised in Thumb state, the \n",
      "processor automatically reverts back to ARM state to handle the \n",
      "exception.\n",
      "• The Thumb SWI instruction has the same effect and nearly the same \n",
      "syntax as the ARM equivalent.\n",
      "• It differs in that the SWI number is limited to the range 0 to 255 and it \n",

      "• Most code written for Thumb is in a high-level language such as C and C++.\n",
      "\n",
      "• ATPCS defines how ARM and Thumb code call each other, called ARM-Thumb interworking.\n",
      "\n",
      "• In Thumb, only the branch instructions are conditionally executed. The barrel shift operations \n",
      "\n",
      "(ASR, LSL, LSR, and ROR) are separate instructions.\n",
      "\n",
      "• The multiple-register load-store instructions only support the increment after (IA) addressing \n",

      "• In practice, many of the input combinations are not possible or won’t\n",
      "   occur.\n",
      "• Let’s start by looking at an example of the problems the compiler \n",
      "faces.\n",
      "\n",
      "\fExample: memclr function\n",
      "\n",
      "• The memclr function clears N bytes of memory at address data.\n",

      "• No matter how advanced the compiler, it does not \n",
      "\n",
      "know whether N can be 0 on input or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Therefore the compiler needs to test for this case \n",
      "explicitly before the first iteration of the loop.\n",
      "\n",
      "• The compiler doesn’t know whether the data array \n",
      "\n",
      "•\n",
      "\n",
      "pointer is four-byte aligned or not.\n",
      "If it is four-byte aligned, then the compiler can clear \n",
      "four bytes at a time using an int store rather than a \n",
      "char store.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Nor does it know whether N is a multiple of four or \n",
      "\n",
      "not.\n",
      "\n",
      "• The compiler must be conservative and assume all \n",

      "•Most of this section covers the first two points \n",
      "above and should be applicable to any ARM C \n",
      "compiler.\n",
      "\n",
      "\fBasic C Data Types\n",
      "\n",
      "• Let’s start by looking at how ARM compilers handle the basic C data types.\n",

      "\n",
      "loading and storing data of each type.\n",
      "\n",
      "• ARM processors have 32-bit registers and 32-bit data processing \n",

      "operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "• The ARM architecture is a RISC load/store architecture.\n",
      "• In other words you must load values from memory into registers before \n",
      "\n",
      "acting on them.\n",
      "\n",
      "• There are no arithmetic or logical instructions that manipulate values in \n",

      "memory directly.\n",

      "• ARMv4-based processors can efficiently load and store 8-, 16-, and \n",
      "32-bit data.\n",
      "• However, most ARM data processing operations are 32-bit only.\n",
      "• For this reason, you should use a 32-bit datatype, int or long, for local \n",
