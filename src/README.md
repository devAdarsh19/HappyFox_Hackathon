# Image Processing Application

## Tools and Skills Utilized

- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **VS Code**
- **Git**

## Project Description

Build an application that performs various image processing tasks.

## Setup and Execution Steps

1. **Set up the project in VS Code.**
    - Open VS Code.
    - Create a new folder for the project.
    - Open the folder in VS Code.

2. **Use OpenCV to implement image processing algorithms.**
    - Install OpenCV by running the command:
      ```bash
      pip install opencv-python
      ```
    - Create Python scripts to implement various image processing tasks using OpenCV.

3. **Develop a user interface for input and output.**
    - Design a simple user interface to take image inputs and display processed outputs.
    - Use libraries like Tkinter for creating the UI.

4. **Use Git for version control.**
    - Initialize a Git repository:
      ```bash
      git init
      ```
    - Add files to the repository:
      ```bash
      git add .
      ```
    - Commit changes:
      ```bash
      git commit -m "Initial commit"
      ```
    - Connect to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub) and push changes:
      ```bash
      git remote add origin <repository-url>
      git push -u origin master
      ```

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Create a new Pull Request.
