# Geospatial Data Analysis

## Project Description
Analyze and visualize geospatial data using QGIS and web technologies.

## Tools and Skills Utilized
- QGIS
- Python
- Django
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- MySQL
- Git

## Setup and Execution Steps

1. **Collect and Preprocess Geospatial Data Using QGIS**
   - Install QGIS from the official website.
   - Load and preprocess geospatial data using QGIS tools.
   - Export the preprocessed data in a suitable format for further analysis.

2. **Store Data in a MySQL Database**
   - Install MySQL and create a new database.
   - Import the preprocessed geospatial data into the MySQL database.
   - Ensure the data is properly structured and indexed for efficient querying.

3. **Develop a Django Backend to Serve Geospatial Data**
   - Set up a Django project and configure it to connect to the MySQL database.
   - Create Django models to represent the geospatial data.
   - Develop RESTful APIs using Django Rest Framework to serve the geospatial data.

4. **Create a React Frontend to Visualize Data on a Map**
   - Set up a React application using Create React App.
   - Use a mapping library (e.g., Leaflet, Mapbox) to visualize the geospatial data.
   - Fetch data from the Django backend and display it on the map.
   - Style the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

5. **Use Git for Version Control**
   - Initialize a Git repository for the project.
   - Commit changes regularly with descriptive messages.
   - Use branches for feature development and merge them into the main branch after review.
